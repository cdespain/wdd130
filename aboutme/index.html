        Hello everyone, my name is Christian, and I am in Pathway studying for a degree in applied technology! I am excited to get back into school and learn some helpful skills that will secure an actual career for me. I love to play video games and board/card games with my family, as well as play piano and ride my bike. I've been a member of the Church all my life, and am grateful for the opportunity to study through BYU-Idaho in a gospel-focused program.

        One of my favorite scriptures is one I encountered in a recent institute class. Isaiaha 1:19 "If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land." This scripture immediately follows the oft-quoted promise that "though [our] sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow," offering us the chance to repent and come unto Him and change our lives. I find it a useful metric for me to remember that the requirements for success in life include being willing and obedient.. being willing to do what the Lord would have me do in my life, and actually following through and doing it! I hope you all have a blessed time in this class, and I look forward to working with you.
