            <h2 class="foundation-h">A Foundation of Light and Truth</h2>
            <p class="foundation-p">The basis of any good musical education is in the tried-and-true foundations of years of musical experience. As it happens, people who spent years devoting their lives to the study of music end up figuring out some very cool things. Especially those people who came from a world more in tune with spirituality and religion. Coinciding with the Restoration of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, a wealth of light and knowledge was infused to the world that affected everything, including music. There is a beautiful honesty about the emotions portrayed in 'classical' works, and in pursuing excellence in any form of music practice, the study of those works is essential.</p>
            <h2 class="excellence-h">Pursuit of Excellence</h2>
            <p class="excellence-p">We are commanded in this life to seek understanding and to increase our knowledge: to develop our talents and to glorify God by consecrating our efforts to His purposes. To that end, it is a worthy effort of any individual to pursue excellence in whatever they do. From algebra and trigonometry, to running a business and writing essays, to baking a pizza or cultivating a garden. Everything we do in life has an eternal analogue, and as we strive in this life to perfect our behavior, skills, and talents, we come closer to Heaven and can more easily see just what it is God has in store for our lives. For me, this pursuit has been largely in performing music. My main hope is that I can cultivate the skills necessary to inspire people and help them see the beautiful things that life has to offer. In order to do so, practice is essential, and learning music theory comes before being able to make compositions of any real import.</p>

            <h2 class="digital-title">Digital Convenience</h2>
            <p class="digital-p">We live in an age of convenience which is both curse and blessing. Never before could the members of the Church so easily share the gospel message with hundreds or thousands of people, with the internet capable of broadcasting General Conference across the globe, and the scriptures being available to everyone and in many languages. Likewise, never before have we been so inundated with terribly persuasive sins of indulgence and self-destruction, with the rise of pornography and predatory social media practices. The digital age is a scary and a mighty place for the progression of sin and love alike, and it is no different with music. I grew up playing on an upright piano in my living room, and nowadays I play on a digital synthesizer plugged into my macbook, able to edit sounds and recording with a mere press of a key. I can change my piano to play the sounds of a flute or an oboe, or mimic a grand piano to the minutest detail of timbre and reverberation. It is an amazingly impressive thing, and one that is humbling for me to try to learn how to use to its fullest potential.</p>
