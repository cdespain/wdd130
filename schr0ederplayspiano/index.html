        <h2>Music is Essential</h2>
        <p>Music is a powerful language that transcends traditional language in its ability to communicate with everyone. It has the ability to influence our emotions and our thoughts, and uplift and inspire worthiness. It also has the power to degrade and debase our thoughts and emotions, encouraging thoughtlessness and carelessness. We must be careful to the music and media we expose ourselves to. Like any language, it can be used to convey profanity and worthiness alike, and we should strive to develop our musical vocabulary just as we would our English - seeking to become most familiar with the language of eternal life and those things that lead us toward God.</p>
        <aside class="aof-13">Article of Faith 13 We believe in being honest, true, chaste, benevolent, virtuous, and in doing egood to all men; indeed, we may say that we follow the admonition of Paulâ€”We believe all things, we hope all things, we have endured many things, and hope to be able to endure all things. If there is anything virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy, we seek after these things.</aside>
        <h2>My Story</h2>
        <p>When I was eight years old, I wanted to get into music and learn an instrument. I knew my father had once been a drummer, and of course to my childish mind that sounded like an awesome thing to pursue. My mother, in her infinite wisdom, encouraged me instead to start taking piano lessons, saying that if I could get some experience with rhythm and music, I would make a better drummer. She would later recount that, after all, a drum solo just isn't inspiring in the same way a piano is. After a few months of piano lessons, I didn't want to switch, all according to her plan. I never regretted it, and have since striven to understand and cultivate the skills necessary to make my piano music uplifting and inspiring.</p>
