      <h4>Music is Essential!</h4>
      <p>
        Music is a powerful language that transcends traditional language in its ability to communicate with everyone. It has the ability to influence our emotions and our thoughts, and uplift and inspire worthiness. It also has the power to degrade and debase our thoughts and emotions, encouraging thoughtlessness and carelessness. We must be careful to the music and media we expose ourselves to. Like any language, it can be used to convey profanity and worthiness alike, and we should strive to develop our musical vocabulary just as we would our English - seeking to become most familiar with the language of eternal life and those things that lead us toward God.

      <h4>My Story</h4>
      <p>
        When I was eight years old, I wanted to get into music and learn an instrument. I knew my father had once been a drummer, and of course to my childish mind that sounded like an awesome thing to pursue. My mother, in her infinite wisdom, encouraged me instead to start taking piano lessons, saying that if I could get some experience with rhythm and music, I would make a better drummer. She would later recount that, after all, a drum solo just isn't inspiring in the same way a piano is. After a few months of piano lessons, I didn't want to switch, all according to her plan. I never regretted it, and have since striven to understand and cultivate the skills necessary to make my piano music uplifting and inspiring.

      <h3>'Classical' & Digital</h3>
      <h4><b>A Foundation of Light and Truth</b></h4>
      <p>
        The basis of any good musical education is in the tried-and-true foundations of years of musical experience. As it happens, people who spent years devoting their lives to the study of music end up figuring out some very cool things. Especially those people who came from a world more in tune with spirituality and religion. Coinciding with the Restoration of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, a wealth of light and knowledge was infused to the world that affected everything, including music. There is a beautiful honesty about the emotions portrayed in 'classical' works, and in pursuing excellence in any form of music practice, the study of those works is essential.
      </p>
      <h4><b>Pursuit of Excellence</b></h4>
      <p>
        We are commanded in this life to seek understanding and to increase our knowledge: to develop our talents and to glorify God by consecrating our efforts to His purposes. To that end, it is a worthy effort of any individual to pursue excellence in whatever they do. From algebra and trigonometry, to running a business and writing essays, to baking a pizza or cultivating a garden. Everything we do in life has an eternal analogue, and as we strive in this life to perfect our behavior, skills, and talents, we come closer to Heaven and can more easily see just what it is God has in store for our lives. For me, this pursuit has been largely in performing music. My main hope is that I can cultivate the skills necessary to inspire people and help them see the beautiful things that life has to offer. In order to do so, practice is essential, and learning music theory comes before being able to make compositions of any real import.
      </p>
      <h4><b>Digital Convenience</b></h4>
      <p>
        We live in an age of convenience which is both curse and blessing. Never before could the members of the Church so easily share the gospel message with hundreds or thousands of people, with the internet capable of broadcasting General Conference across the globe, and the scriptures being available to everyone and in many languages. Likewise, never before have we been so inundated with terribly persuasive sins of indulgence and self-destruction, with the rise of pornography and predatory social media practices. The digital age is a scary and a mighty place for the progression of sin and love alike, and it is no different with music. I grew up playing on an upright piano in my living room, and nowadays I play on a digital synthesizer plugged into my macbook, able to edit sounds and recording with a mere press of a key. I can change my piano to play the sounds of a flute or an oboe, or mimic a grand piano to the minutest detail of timbre and reverberation. It is an amazingly impressive thing, and one that is humbling for me to try to learn how to use to its fullest potential.

      <h3>Projects</h3>
      <h4><b>Video Games</b></h4>
      <p> 
        My personal passion for music comes from my desire to make a video game. I have always loved to play video games, and I think more than any other format of media they represent a unique opportunity and challenge. They offer us a glimpse into our own minds better than any other type of media, because they present the player with a sense of agency and consequence. Games have the potential to teach us about things we could never experience in real life, and help us relate to characters real and fictional that can help us gain awareness of truths we may never have realized.
      </p>
      <h4><b>Soundtrack</b></h4>
      <p>
        One of the most influential tools at the disposal of a game designer is the soundtrack and audio design. Music speaks to us on an emotional level, and it has been my dream to be able to compose a moving soundtrack that could accompany a game and help people have amazing experiences.
