        <h2 class="vg-h">Video Games</h2>
        <p class="vg-p"> My personal passion for music comes from my desire to make a video game. I have always loved to play video games, and I think more than any other format of media they represent a unique opportunity and challenge. They offer us a glimpse into our own minds better than any other type of media, because they present the player with a sense of agency and consequence. Games have the potential to teach us about things we could never experience in real life, and help us relate to characters real and fictional that can help us gain awareness of truths we may never have realized.</p>
        <h2 class="projects-h">Projects/Soundtrack</h2>
        <p class="projects-p">One of the most influential tools at the disposal of a game designer is the soundtrack and audio design. Music speaks to us on an emotional level, and it has been my dream to be able to compose a moving soundtrack that could accompany a game and help people have amazing experiences.</p>
